# Document-an-incident-with-an-incident-handler-s-journal

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will review the details of a security incident and document the incident using your incident handler's journal. Previously, you learned about the importance of documentation in the incident response process. You've also learned how an incident handler's journal is used to record information about security incidents as they are handled. 

Throughout this course, you can apply your documentation skills using your incident handler's journal. With this journal, you can record information about the experiences you will have analyzing security incident scenarios through the course activities. 

By the time you complete this course you will have multiple entries in your incident handler's journal that you can use as a helpful reference to recall concepts and tools. Later, you'll add this document to your cybersecurity portfolio, which you can share with prospective employers or recruiters.

Be sure to complete this activity and answer the questions that follow before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. 

Note: You can use your incident handler's journal as a personal space where you can keep track of your learning journey as you learn about incident detection and response concepts and interact with different cybersecurity tools. Feel free to include your thoughts, reflections, and any other important details or information.

Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

A small U.S. health care clinic specializing in delivering primary-care services experienced a security incident on a Tuesday morning, at approximately 9:00 a.m. Several employees reported that they were unable to use their computers to access files like medical records. Business operations shut down because employees were unable to access the files and software needed to do their job.

Additionally, employees also reported that a ransom note was displayed on their computers. The ransom note stated that all the company's files were encrypted by an organized group of unethical hackers who are known to target organizations in healthcare and transportation industries. In exchange for restoring access to the encrypted files, the ransom note demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. 

The attackers were able to gain access into the company's network by using targeted phishing emails, which were sent to several employees of the company. The phishing emails contained a malicious attachment that installed malware on the employee's computer once it was downloaded.

Once the attackers gained access, they deployed their ransomware, which encrypted critical files. The company was unable to access critical patient data, causing major disruptions in their business operations. The company was forced to shut down their computer systems and contact several organizations to report the incident and receive technical assistance.
